                &nbsp;&nbsp;A platform where gyms could register and showcase their facilities,
                equipment, location, and pricing, making it easier for people searching for a gym to find the best
                option for their needs.
                On the gym owner's side, the platform streamlined operations such as managing membership, offering an
                integrated online store
                within the gym's page, and providing insightful statistics to support business growth.

                the services/departments
                of the Instituto Polit√©cnico de Set√∫bal. The application offers features such as secure authentication,
                profile management,
                notifications, direct messaging, discussion groups and integration with academic services. In addition,
                it allows scheduling meetings,
                sending request forms, accessing the academic calendar, department contact information and an
                interactive campus map. IPSLink aims to
                improve the accessibility and efficiency of communication within the institution.

                network.
                The main goal is to allow users to interact with the network, retrieve information about bus stops and
                routes, calculate metrics,
                and modify real-time data such as route distances and durations. Additionally, the project includes
                generating tickets and exporting
                new data sets. The application will be graphically visualized using JavaFXSmartGraph, and all code was
                documented with Javadoc.

              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;This project involves the implementation of the AJ-KP-BS algorithm to solve the 0-1 knapsack
                problem, using parallel
                and concurrent programming techniques in Java. The goal is to maximize the total value of selected items
                while ensuring that the
                total weight does not exceed the knapsack's capacity. The solution includes the creation of multiple
                threads executing the AJ-KP-BS
                algorithm, sharing information about the best solutions found. Proper synchronization between threads is
                essential to avoid conflicts
                when accessing shared memory. The results are presented in tables that include the test number, test
                name, execution time, number of
                threads used, best value found, total weight of the best solution, number of iterations, and time to
                reach the best solution.
                The project is developed in Java, utilizing parallel and concurrent programming techniques such as
                threads and semaphores.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;This project aimed to restructure a relational database for the fictitious company Wide
                World Importers (WWI),
                which was transitioning from an outdated system to a new ERP. The goal was to model and normalize the
                existing data, integrating
                it into a new database called WWIGlobal for improved efficiency, integrity, and scalability.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Normalization techniques reduced redundancy and improved data integrity, while metadata
                ensured proper documentation
                for future management. Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams were created to guide the data structure
                design. The process included data
                migration, creation of relational tables with appropriate keys and constraints, and SQL scripting to
                manipulate and validate data.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;Triggers were implemented to enforce business rules, and stored procedures streamlined
                complex operations.
                Views simplified data retrieval, and indexes improved query performance. Additionally, referential
                integrity and transaction
                management ensured data consistency and reliability.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;This project involves developing a data layer to support a sports event management
                application. The system
                will manage both the sports activities and the accommodation of participants. Each team will choose a
                specific sport, such as individual
                or team-based events, and design the data structure to handle the event logistics, including participant
                accommodation and required materials.
                The focus is on implementing secure procedures to manage user creation and queries while ensuring the
                integrity of the data, avoiding
                risks like SQL injection.

                across a 10x10 chessboard,
                visiting each square exactly once. Each square has a score, and the aim is to maximize the total score
