                  &nbsp;&nbsp;I hold a Bachelor's degree in
                  <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> and have completed two
                  internships, where I gained hands-on experience in
                  <strong>software development</strong> and process
                  optimization. These opportunities allowed me to apply my
                  academic knowledge in real-world scenarios, deepening my
                  understanding of the importance of organization and efficiency
                  in <strong>software projects</strong>.

                <p>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;I am passionate about solving complex problems,
                  particularly in the area of data structures and algorithms
                  <strong>(DSA)</strong>. In my free time, I enjoy honing these
                  skills, which keeps my critical thinking sharp and
                  continuously enhances my programming abilities. I believe that
                  tackling challenging problems is an excellent way to expand my
                  knowledge and improve as a <strong>developer</strong>.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;A startup focused on developing innovative
                    solutions. I chose to intern at a startup to gain deeper
                    integration within the project and take on more significant
                    responsibilities, allowing me to gain valuable experience.

                  <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the mobile application, Mordomo, was
                    to help users find the best electricity bill offers
                    available on the market. Users could upload their
                    electricity invoices, and based on their tariff type and
                    power consumption, the system would return the most
                    competitive offers.

                  <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;My role as a Backend Developer involved
                    designing, developing, and managing the backend, including
                    the back-office system. I was responsible for improving and
                    implementing efficient algorithms to optimize the offer
                    selection process, ensuring accurate and relevant
                    recommendations for users.

                    my bachelor's degree and is featured in my "Projects" page.
                    This project involved budgeting, diagrams, and a strong
                    theoretical foundation applied throughout its development.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of EasyFitHub was to create a platform
                    where gyms could register and showcase their facilities,
                    equipment, location, and pricing, making it easier for
                    people searching for a gym to find the best option for their
                    needs. On the gym owner's side, the platform streamlined
                    operations such as managing membership, offering an
                    integrated online store within the gym's page, and providing
                    insightful statistics to support business growth.

                    SFOAmorense's taekwondo dojo by showcasing the benefits of
                    the classes and how welcoming the environment was. A
                    promotional video was also edited and integrated into the
                    website to encourage people to sign up with some personal
                    details. Once the registration was complete, the dojo would

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;I worked on the project as a full-stack

                    included designing the user interface, implementing the

                    registration process was smooth.

                    The main goal is to allow users to interact with the
                    network, retrieve information about bus stops and routes,
                    calculate metrics, and modify real-time data such as route

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;This project involves the implementation of the
                    AJ-KP-BS algorithm to solve the 0-1 knapsack problem, using
                    parallel and concurrent programming techniques in Java. The
                    goal is to maximize the total value of selected items while
                    ensuring that the total weight does not exceed the
                    knapsack's capacity. The solution includes the creation of
                    multiple threads executing the AJ-KP-BS algorithm, sharing
                    information about the best solutions found. Proper
                    synchronization between threads is essential to avoid
                    conflicts when accessing shared memory. The results are
                    presented in tables that include the test number, test name,
                    execution time, number of threads used, best value found,
                    total weight of the best solution, number of iterations, and
                    time to reach the best solution. The project is developed in
                    Java, utilizing parallel and concurrent programming
                    techniques such as threads and semaphores.

                    (WWI), which was transitioning from an outdated system to a
                    new ERP. The goal was to model and normalize the existing

                    for improved efficiency, integrity, and scalability.

                    (ER) diagrams were created to guide the data structure
                    design. The process included data migration, creation of

                    move the knight to visit all squares while maximizing the
                    score, an AI uses state space search to find the optimal
                    path that visits all squares and maximizes the score.
