              <h3>- Description:</h3>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;This internship was part of my bachelor's degree, a startup focused on developing innovative solutions. 
                I chose to intern at a startup to gain deeper integration within the project and take on more significant responsibilities, 
                allowing me to gain valuable experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the mobile application, Mordomo, was to help users find the best electricity bill offers available on the market. 
                Users could upload their electricity invoices, and based on their tariff type and power consumption, the system would return the most 
                competitive offers.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;My role as a Backend Developer involved designing, developing, and managing the backend, including the back-office system. 
                I was responsible for improving and implementing efficient algorithms to optimize the offer selection process, ensuring accurate and 
                relevant recommendations for users.

              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;The EasyFitHub project was the main project of my bachelor's degree and is featured in my "Projects" page. 
                This project involved budgeting, diagrams, and a strong theoretical foundation applied throughout its development.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of EasyFitHub was to create a platform where gyms could register and showcase their facilities, equipment, 
                location, and pricing, making it easier for people searching for a gym to find the best option for their needs. On the gym owner's side, 
                the platform streamlined operations such as managing membership, offering an integrated online store within the gym's page, and providing 
                insightful statistics to support business growth.

              <h3>- Description:</h3>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of my first intership was to make a website advertising and influencing people to book a
                trial class at SFOAmorense's taekwondo dojo by showcasing the benefits of the classes and how welcoming
                the environment was. A promotional video was also edited and integrated into the website to encourage
                people to sign up with some personal details. Once the registration was complete, the dojo would contact
                the individual to schedule a class.
              </p>
              <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;I worked on the project as a full-stack developer, handling both the frontend and backend.
                This included designing the user interface, implementing the website's interactive elements, and
                ensuring the registration process was smooth.
